NodeJs, Express Framework on its Backend.

## Tools and Technologies : 

1. Angular
2. TypeScript
3. Nodejs
4. Express
5. Mongodb

## Building an app : 

Our project on FHSC Web Application is based on some concepts and 
methodologies that we devised during our initial study and visualization of the 
project. We have planned our project keeping in mind the Object Oriented 
Concepts that can be applied to the project.

The project is strongly supported at the back end by NodeJs and Express-the most 
popular and successful Backend Frameworks. 

The front end is developed using Angular framework. 

The initial idea was to improve the digital location system which is being in use for 
the past decades. The idea was to help the users to know about the nearest 
places which suits their needs. 

It is divided into the three sections : 

1. Food Zone : 

        In this section, list of nearby street foods, cafes and hotels are listed. 
        They are dynamically displayed. It contains some filters : 
        a. Food-type(whether it should be street food, caf√© or hotel)
        b. Food taste( whether it should be south Indian, fast food and many 
        other options).
        c. Distance Factor
        d. Ratings
        
2. Hospital Zone : 

        In this section, list of nearby hospitals are listed. They are dynamically 
        displayed. It contains some filters :
